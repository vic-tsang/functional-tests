"""Emit the CI test matrix from the compose file.

The CI workflow runs the suite once per test target. Rather than duplicating the
target list (ports, profiles, connection strings) in the workflow YAML, this
module derives the matrix from ``dev/compose.yaml`` — the same single source of
truth the test harness reads via :mod:`documentdb_tests.framework.engine_registry`.

Run as ``python -m documentdb_tests.framework.ci_matrix`` to print a JSON array
of target objects, one per target::

    [{"name": ..., "profile": ..., "connection_string": ..., "engine": ...}, ...]

Each target's compose profile is the service's first declared profile, which by
convention equals the service (target) name.
