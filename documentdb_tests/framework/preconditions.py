"""Capability resolution for environment-gated tests.

A test case may apply only to targets that have (or lack) a particular
capability. It declares this with the ``requires`` marker, naming capabilities
and whether each must be present::

    @pytest.mark.requires(change_streams=True)     # only where change streams exist
    @pytest.mark.requires(change_streams=False)    # only where they do not
    @pytest.mark.requires(transactions=True, cluster_admin=True)

A capability is any named fact about a target -- a feature it provides (change
streams, transactions) or a behavior it exhibits (compact succeeding without
``force``). The test is skipped against a target whose capabilities do not match
what it requires.

For a given engine, which capabilities a target has is fully determined by its
topology (e.g. a standalone server vs a replica set). The engine is always known
(it is declared per target) and the topology is detected once from a live
connection. The pair ``(engine, topology)`` then selects the present
capabilities from a static table, so there is a single declarative source of
truth for every engine and topology and the manual-connection path resolves
identically to auto-discovered targets.

The expected behavior of a case is the reference engine's behavior, applied
uniformly to all engines (a compatible engine is measured against it, never
defining its own). Adding an engine or a new topology (e.g. a search-backed
deployment) is a new row in ``_CAPABILITIES_BY_PROFILE`` plus teaching
``_detect_topology`` to recognize it.
