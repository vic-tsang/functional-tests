# DocumentDB Compatibility Test Coverage Guidelines

**Purpose**: Define compatibility test coverage requirements for DocumentDB features to ensure complete validation.

**Target Spec Version**: MongoDB 8.2.4 (see `.github/workflows/pr-tests.yml` for the authoritative image version)

**xfail Policy**: `engine_xfail("mongodb")` is for confirmed MongoDB bugs where MongoDB itself returns incorrect results. DocumentDB failures are **not** handled here — they are tracked in the DocumentDB main repo.

**Usage**: Use this document as a checklist when adding tests for a feature. Walk through each numbered section and confirm coverage exists or is not applicable.

---

## High-Level Guidelines

### Compatibility Tests, Not Functional Tests

These are **compatibility tests based on feature specs**. We validate that DocumentDB produces the same output as the spec defines for each feature's own behavior. We do **not** comprehensively test shared/implied behavior that belongs to other features.

**What to test**: Behavior specific to the feature under test.  
**What NOT to test**: Shared infrastructure behavior that is already covered by the feature that owns it.

**Example**: When testing `$divide`:
- ✅ Test that `$divide` returns correct results for numeric type combinations (this is `$divide`'s own spec)
- ✅ Test that `$divide` rejects invalid types with correct error codes (this is `$divide`'s own spec)
- ❌ Do NOT exhaustively test field path resolution like `"$a.b.c"` on deeply nested arrays (this belongs to the expression engine tests under `expressions/`)
- ✅ DO add one smoke test that `$divide` accepts a field path input (confirms wiring, not field path semantics)

The distinction: thorough coverage of shared mechanics lives in the feature that owns them. Per-feature tests only confirm the wiring works (one test per expression type, not exhaustive permutations).

### Adding Tests Requires Multiple Paths

Adding tests for a single feature often requires modifications across multiple directories:

1. **Feature's dedicated path** — Core behavior, argument validation, type coverage  
   Example: `tests/core/operator/expressions/arithmetic/divide/`

2. **Parent folder** — Interaction tests with sibling features (only add if their interactions have special specs)  
   Example: `tests/core/operator/expressions/test_expressions_combination_date_construct_operators.py` (e.g., `$dateToString` wrapping `$dateFromString` round-trip verifies millisecond preservation; `$toDate` vs `$convert` equivalence for string/long/ObjectId inputs)

3. **Upper-level container feature** — Wiring tests in pipeline stages that consume the feature  
   Example: `tests/core/operator/aggregation/stages/project/test_operators_in_project.py` (one test confirming `$divide` works in `$project`)

4. **Cross-cutting feature paths** — Tests combining with orthogonal features  
   Example: `tests/cross_cutting/collation/test_collation_find.py` (e.g., adding a new string comparison operator requires a test that it respects collation strength levels for case/accent insensitivity)

**Concrete example** — adding `$strcasecmp`:
| Path | What goes there |
|------|----------------|
| `expressions/string/strcasecmp/test_strcasecmp.py` | Core: string comparisons, argument count validation (0, 1, 3+ args error), null/missing per position, all BSON types per position |
| `expressions/string/strcasecmp/test_strcasecmp_unicode.py` | Unicode: multi-byte chars, accented characters, locale-sensitive ordering |
| `expressions/string/` (parent) | Interaction: `$strcasecmp` with `$concat` output, `$toLower`/`$toUpper` — verify comparison after case transformation |
| `stages/project/test_operators_in_project.py` | Wiring: one test of `$strcasecmp` in `$project` |
| `stages/group/test_operators_in_group.py` | Wiring: one test of `$strcasecmp` in `$group` |
| `stages/match/test_operators_in_match_expr.py` | Wiring: one test of `$strcasecmp` in `$match` + `$expr` |
| `cross_cutting/collation/test_collation_aggregate.py` | Cross-cutting: `$strcasecmp` ignores collation (it always uses simple binary comparison) — verify it does NOT change behavior when collation is set |

---

## Global Rules

- **No error precedence tests** — Don't test which error fires first when multiple params are invalid. Each error should be tested individually.
- **One layer deep only** — Test the feature itself and one layer of composition.
  - `$project` with expressions: one test per operator, no edge cases of the operator.
  - `$lookup` sub-pipeline: verify stages are accepted/rejected, don't test the stage's full behavior inside the sub-pipeline.
- **No engine-specific implementation details** — Don't test internal storage details (wiredTiger, engine-specific fields, etc.). These belong in engine-specific test suites, not compatibility tests.
- **Tests belong in the feature's folder** — `$abs` type validation goes in `expressions/arithmetic/abs/`, not in `stages/project/`. Testing `$abs` inside `$project` is a `$project` context test (one simple case), not an `$abs` test.
- **No deprecated / removed features** — Do not write tests for the following deprecated or removed MongoDB features:
  - **`mapReduce` command** — removed in MongoDB 8.0.
  - **`reIndex` command** — removed in MongoDB 6.0.
  - **JavaScript `function` in queries** — server-side JavaScript execution is deprecated.
  - **`$accumulator` operator** — custom JavaScript accumulator; depends on deprecated server-side JS.
  - **`$where` operator** — server-side JavaScript query operator; deprecated.
  - **`currentOp` command** — administrative/diagnostic command; not in scope for compatibility tests.
  - **`filemd5` command** — GridFS internal command; deprecated in MongoDB 6.0.
  - **`collStats` command** — deprecated in MongoDB 6.2 in favor of the `$collStats` aggregation stage.

---

## Core Testing Principles

### 1. Data Type Coverage
**Rule**: Every command/operator input must be tested with ALL DocumentDB data types. Use constants and datasets from `framework/test_constants.py` for consistent test values.

**Standard Data Types** (non-deprecated BSON types):
- **Numeric**: double, int, long, decimal128 → `NUMERIC`, `NUMERIC_INT32`, `NUMERIC_INT64`, `NUMERIC_DOUBLE`, `NUMERIC_DECIMAL128`
- **String**: string
- **Boolean**: bool
- **Date**: date
- **Null**: null
- **Object**: object
- **Array**: array
- **Binary data**: binData
- **ObjectId**: objectId
- **Regular Expression**: regex
- **JavaScript**: javascript
- **Timestamp**: timestamp
- **MinKey**: minKey
- **MaxKey**: maxKey

**Type Test Matrix**:
- Valid types (should succeed)
- Invalid types (should fail with appropriate error code)
- Type conversion behavior
- Type precedence in operations

---

### 2. Arithmetic Operator Coverage
**Rule**: Arithmetic operators must test all numeric type combinations and edge cases.

**Multi-Input Operators** (e.g., $add, $subtract, $multiply, $divide, $mod):

**Numeric Type Combinations**:
```
double + double → double
double + int → double
double + long → double
double + decimal128 → decimal128
int + int → int
int + long → long
int + decimal128 → decimal128
long + long → long
long + decimal128 → decimal128
decimal128 + decimal128 → decimal128
```

**Single-Input Operators** (e.g., $ln, $log10, $exp, $abs, $ceil, $floor, $sqrt, $trunc):

**Input → Output Type Conversion**:
```
double → double
int → double (for operators that produce non-integer results like $ln, $exp, $sqrt)
int → int (for operators that preserve integers like $abs, $ceil, $floor, $trunc)
long → double (for operators that produce non-integer results)
long → long (for operators that preserve integers)
decimal128 → decimal128
```
Note: Check each operator's specific return type rules. The general pattern is: decimal128 input always returns decimal128; other numeric types return double unless the operator preserves integer types.

Note: Distinguish between fractional doubles (2.5) and whole-number doubles (3.0). Some operators coerce whole-number doubles to int, producing different behavior than fractional doubles.

**Edge Cases for Arithmetic**:
- **NaN handling**: operation with NaN → NaN
- **Infinity handling**: 
  - number + Infinity → Infinity
  - Infinity + Infinity → Infinity
  - Infinity + (-Infinity) → NaN
  - -Infinity + (-Infinity) → -Infinity
- **Overflow**: `INT32_MAX` + 1 → long, `INT64_MAX` + 1 → double
- **Underflow**: `INT32_MIN` - 1 → long, `INT64_MIN` - 1 → double
- **Sign handling**: positive, negative, zero
- **Negative zero**: `DOUBLE_NEGATIVE_ZERO` → verify behavior (some operators normalize to `0.0`, others preserve `-0.0`); `DECIMAL128_NEGATIVE_ZERO` → verify; `NumberDecimal("-0E+N")` and `NumberDecimal("-0E-N")` → verify exponent preservation
- **Special values**: MinKey, MaxKey combinations
- **Two's complement asymmetry (single-input operators)**: `INT32_MIN` has no positive int counterpart → must promote to long; `INT64_MIN` has no positive long counterpart → verify overflow/error behavior
- **Double precision boundaries**: `DOUBLE_NEAR_MAX`, `DOUBLE_MIN_SUBNORMAL`, `DOUBLE_MIN_NEGATIVE_SUBNORMAL`, `DOUBLE_NEAR_MIN`, `DOUBLE_NEGATIVE_ZERO` → use `NUMERIC_DOUBLE` from `test_constants.py`

---

### 3. Expression Type Coverage
**Rule**: Expression types and field paths must be tested at two levels: thorough expression engine tests (under `expressions/`) that cover shared behavior like field path resolution and nesting, and per-operator smoke tests (under each operator's folder) that confirm each operator accepts each expression type.

**Expression Types**:
- **Literal**: `1`, `"hello"`, `true`
- **Field**: `"$x"`, `"$a.b"`
- **System Variables**: `$$ROOT`, `$$CURRENT`, `$$REMOVE`
- **Expression operator**: `{$abs: -1}`, `{$add: [1, 2]}`
- **Array expression**: `["$x", "$y"]`, `[{$abs: -1}]`
- **Object expression**: `{a: "$x"}`, `{a: {$abs: -1}}`

#### Expression Engine Tests (under `expressions/`)
Tests the expression parser/evaluator mechanics (field path resolution, nesting, system variables). These are shared behavior across all operators — run once with a representative operator.

Example path: `documentdb_tests/compatibility/tests/core/operator/expressions/test_field_paths.py`

**Embedding/Nesting (thorough)**:
- Expression in object: `{a: {$abs: -1}}`
- Expression in array: `[{$abs: -1}]`
- Nested expressions: `{$add: [{$abs: "$x"}, {$abs: "$y"}]}`
- Deep nesting: `{$add: [1, {$abs: {$ceil: {$sqrt: "$x"}}}]}`
- Complex: `{a: [{$add: [1, {$abs: "$x"}]}, {b: {$ceil: "$y"}}]}`

**Field Path Resolution (thorough)**:
- Simple: `"$a"` on `{a: 1}`
- Nested object: `"$a.b"` on `{a: {b: 1}}`
- Composite array: `"$a.b"` on `{a: [{b: 1}, {b: 2}]}`
- Array index: `"$a.0.b"` on `{a: [{b: 1}, {b: 2}]}`
- Nested arrays: `"$a.b"` on `{a: [[{b: 1}], [{b: 2}]]}`
- Deep nested: `"$a.b.c.d"` on `{a: {b: [{c: [{d: 1}]}]}}`
- Non-existent: `"$missing"` → null
- Non-existent nested: `"$x.y.0"` on `{}`
- Array index path in expression context: `"$a.0.b"` — valid in filter query, verify behavior in aggregation expressions

**System Variables (thorough)**:
- `$$ROOT` in various nesting contexts
- `$$CURRENT` equivalence to field paths
- `$$REMOVE` in conditional branches
- `$let` with complex variable definitions

#### Per-Operator Tests (under each operator's folder)
Each operator must test these because behavior differs per operator and per input.

Example path: `documentdb_tests/compatibility/tests/core/operator/expressions/arithmetic/divide/test_divide.py`

**Per-operator expression type tests (one test per type)**: Each operator must verify it handles each expression type correctly, as behavior may differ per operator:
- With array expression input: `{$add: [["$x", "$y"]]}` — array containing field references
- With object expression input: `{$add: {a: "$x"}}` — object with field reference values
- With composite array input: doc `{a: [{b: 1}, {b: 2}]}`, expression `{$add: "$a.b"}` — field path resolving to array from array-of-objects

**`$missing` field behavior**: operators handling differ. Must test per operator and per input position

**Array index paths in expression context**: `"$a.0.b"` — verify whether the operator supports this for `{"a": {"0": {"b": 1}}}` or `{"a": [{"b": 1}, {"b": 2}]}`

**System variables**: only test if the official documentation says the operator supports them

---

### 4. Argument Handling
**Rule 1**: Test various argument counts and formats.

**Argument Count Variations**:
- **No arguments**: `{$add: []}`
- **Single argument**: `{$add: [1]}` and `{$add: 1}`
- **Two arguments**: `{$add: [1, 2]}`
- **Multiple arguments**: `{$add: [1, 2, 3, 4]}`

**Rule 2**: Each input position must be tested independently against all applicable rules. Different input positions may accept different types.

**Per-Input-Position Coverage**:
- **Data types**: test every valid and invalid data type per position
- **Expression types**: literal, field, expression operator, array expression, object expression per position
- **All other applicable rules** from this document (edge cases, special values, etc.)

**Examples**:
- `$add`: 2 kinds of input — 1st accepts date or numeric; 2nd and beyond accept numeric only.
- `$sum`: 1 kind of input — all inputs are numeric, test rules once on any single input position (no need to repeat for each position).
- `$subtract`: 2 inputs, each must be tested with every data type, expression type, and applicable rules independently.
- `$cond`: 3 inputs (condition, then, else) — each has different valid types and semantics.

**Rule 3**: Test correlations between inputs that interact. Only test meaningful combinations where both inputs are valid types but their interaction produces different behavior.

**Correlation Testing**:
- Identify which inputs interact (affect each other's behavior or output)
- Test valid cross-input combinations that produce different behavior
- Skip combinations where one input doesn't affect the other's semantics
- Skip (invalid, invalid) pairs — different engines may parse inputs in different order, returning different error codes for the same (invalid, invalid) combination. Per-input tests already verify each invalid type is rejected.

**Examples**:
- `$add`: 1st is date → test 2nd with all numeric types (int/long/double/decimal128). No need to test 2nd with invalid types again (already covered by per-input testing).
- `$unwind`: `path` and `includeArrayIndex` can conflict (same path) → test permutations. `preserveNullAndEmptyArrays` has no significant interaction with the other two → no correlation tests needed.

---

### 5. Date Arithmetic Coverage
**Rule**: Date operations must test numeric additions and special cases.

**Date Test Cases**:
- **Date + numeric types**: ISODate + int/long/double/decimal128
- **Rounding behavior**: Date + fractional values: `0.1`, `0.49`, `0.5`, `0.51`, `0.6`, `1.5`, `-0.5`, `-0.51`
- **Invalid combinations**:
  - Date + Date (should fail)
  - Date + Infinity (should fail)
  - Date + NaN (should fail)
  - Date + non-numeric types (should fail)
- **Overflow**: Date + LONG_MAX (should fail)
- **Timezone awareness**: Use `CodecOptions(tz_aware=True, tzinfo=timezone.utc)` to verify timezone-aware datetime decoding, e.g. `datetime(2024, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc)`

---

### 6. Error Code Validation
**Rule**: Invalid operations must return correct error codes. Only assert on error codes, not error messages — messages are not part of the spec and may change between versions.

**Error Test Pattern**:
```
For each invalid_type in [string, object, array, ...]:
    Test operation with invalid_type fails with error code X
```

---

### 7. Decimal128 Precision Coverage
**Rule**: Decimal128 operations must test precision boundaries. Use `NUMERIC_DECIMAL128` and individual constants from `test_constants.py` (e.g., `DECIMAL128_MAX`, `DECIMAL128_MIN`, `DECIMAL128_SMALL_EXPONENT`).

**Decimal128 Test Cases**:
- **Precision boundaries**: `DECIMAL128_MAX`, `DECIMAL128_MIN`, `DECIMAL128_SMALL_EXPONENT`, `DECIMAL128_LARGE_EXPONENT`, `DECIMAL128_ZERO`, `DECIMAL128_NEGATIVE_ZERO`
- **High precision**: Results with >35 digits
- **Exponent boundaries**: Maximum and minimum exponents
- **Rounding behavior**: Precision loss scenarios
- **Special values**: Decimal128 Infinity, NaN

---

### 8. Null Field Handling
**Rule**: Test null propagation and missing field behavior.

**Null Patterns**:
- **Null propagation**: operation(value, null) → null
- **Null + Null**: null

---

### 9. Numeric Equivalence in Grouping/Comparison
**Rule**: Test that numerically equivalent values across types are treated as identical for grouping, matching, and deduplication.

**Equivalence Groups**:
- `NumberInt(1)`, `NumberLong(1)`, `1.0`, `NumberDecimal("1")` → same group
- `NumberInt(0)`, `NumberLong(0)`, `0.0`, `NumberDecimal("0")` → same group
- `false` vs `0`, `true` vs `1` → **NOT** equivalent (BSON type distinction)

**Applies to**: `$group`, `$match`, `$lookup`, `$addToSet`, `$setUnion`, `$setIntersection`, indexes, `$eq`/`$ne` comparisons, `distinct`

---

### 10. BSON Type Distinction
**Rule**: Test that values of different BSON types are treated as distinct even when they appear equivalent in some languages.

**Key Distinctions**:
- `false` vs `NumberInt(0)` → distinct
- `true` vs `NumberInt(1)` → distinct
- `null` vs `$missing` → check per-operator (some treat as same, some don't)
- `""` (empty string) vs `null` → distinct

**Applies to**: any context involving comparison, grouping, deduplication, or matching

---

### 11. Expression Operator in Pipeline Contexts
**Rule**: Each expression operator must have one test case in each pipeline context. When generating tests for an operator (e.g., `$add`), create one test case per context in the corresponding stage/feature folder.

**Does NOT apply to**: query operators (i.e., operators under `operators/query/`). These are tested via `find()` and command filter parameters, not via aggregation pipeline stages.

**Pipeline Contexts** (one test case per operator per context):
- In `core/operator/aggregation/stages/project`: `{$project: {result: {$op: "$field"}}}`
- In `core/operator/aggregation/stages/match` with `$expr`: `{$match: {$expr: {$gt: [{$op: "$field"}, value]}}}`
- In `core/operator/aggregation/stages/group` expression: `{$group: {_id: null, result: {$max: {$op: "$field"}}}}` and `{$group: {_id: {$max: {$op: "$field"}}}}`
- Don't need to add for every operator in find filter $expr: (should have same behavior with aggregation with $expr)
- Don't need to add for every operator in `find()` computed projection: (should have same behavior with aggregation)
- Don't need to add for every operator in `core/operator/aggregation/stages/set`: (alias for `$addFields`, separate code path)
- Don't need to add for every operator in `$lookup` and `$facet` pipeline: (too deep nesting)

**Example**: generating `$add` tests adds test cases in these files:
- `stages/project/test_operators_in_project.py`
- `stages/match/test_operators_in_match_expr.py`
- `stages/group/test_operators_in_group.py`

**Applies to**: all expression operators (`$abs`, `$add`, `$ceil`, `$floor`, `$sqrt`, `$concat`, etc.)

---

### 12. Object Expression Test Coverage
**Rule**: All sizes, shapes, and types of documents must be tested in object expressions.

**Key Cases**:
- Documents of different shapes must be tested:
  - Empty documents
  - Flat documents, including all scalar types
  - Deeply nested documents ($a.b.c.d)
  - Nested arrays (`{arr: [[1,2], [3,4]]}`, `{obj: {arr: [1,2,3]}}`)
- For object manipulation:
  - Overwriting existing fields returns object with new value
  - Removing non-existent fields has no effect and returns original object
  - Original document is not updated, only the returned object
  - $set/unsetField does not traverse objects or arrays, it only works upon top level fields
    - Test this using $replaceWith
  - Field names with periods or dollar ($) signs require $replaceWith
- Inputs other than objects, nulls, or undefined values are rejected
- Verify that $mergeObjects accepts an array of any number of objects
- For $mergeObjects, verify that field conflicts prioritize the last document

**Applies to**: object expression operators (`$mergeObjects`, `$setField`, `$unsetField`, `$getField`)

---
### 13. Meta Operator Coverage
	 
	 **Rule**: `$meta` should be tested in the two modes supported by version 8.x: `textScore` and `indexKey`. These operators
	 have little effect in isolation, but return metadata of query results.
	 
	 **textScore**
	 - Returns a float score indicating how well a document matches a `$text` search.
	 - If `textScore` is used without a `$text` an error is returned.
	 - `$meta` tests do not comprehensively test `$text` queries, only that the `$meta` operator returns text scores when a `$text` query is used.
	 
	 **indexKey**
	 - If an index is used in a query `indexKey` returns the key of that index.
	 - `indexKey` should be tested with different index types while minimally testing the indexes themselves.
	   - Basic, compound key, array, sparse, text, and hashed indexes
	 - If no index is used, the field is absent.
	 
	 ---
	

### 14. Variable Operator Coverage
**Rule**: Variable operators must be tested for value passthrough fidelity, expression suppression, scoping, and argument validation.

**Behavior**:
- **BSON type passthrough**: Test all BSON types to verify no coercion or precision loss. Type distinctions must be preserved (e.g. false ≠ 0, "" ≠ null, Decimal128("-0E+3") preserves exponent).
- **Expression suppression**: `$literal` returns its argument as-is — expressions, field paths, and system variables are treated as plain values, not evaluated. `$let` evaluates `in` only within its declared variable scope.
- **Project disambiguation**: `{"$literal": 1}` sets a field to value 1, not an inclusion flag — same for 0, true, false. Objects with dollar-prefixed keys, dot-containing keys, or operator-named keys are returned unchanged.
- **Scoping** (`$let`): Variables in vars cannot reference each other. Nested `$let` can shadow outer variables without leaking. System variables (`$$ROOT`, `$$CURRENT`, `$$REMOVE`, `$$NOW`) are accessible but cannot be redefined in vars.
- **Variable naming** (`$let`): Names must start with a lowercase letter or non-ASCII character. Uppercase, digits, special characters, and system variable names are rejected as starting characters. Dots and hyphens are rejected anywhere; underscores and digits are allowed after the first character.
- **Path lookup** (`$let`): `"$$x.a.b"` traverses the variable's value. Non-existent paths omit the field. Paths on array-of-objects return an array of matched values. Null propagates; missing field paths omit the field.
- **Argument validation**: `$literal` takes exactly one argument. `$let` requires both vars (object) and in — missing either, non-object vars, or unknown fields produce distinct errors.
- **Operator interaction**: Variable operators should be tested in combination with conditional (`$cond`), iteration (`$map`, `$reduce`, `$filter`), and access control (`$redact`) operators to verify scope isolation.

**Applies to**: `$let`, `$literal`

---

### 15. Pipeline Stage Coverage
**Rule**: Each aggregation pipeline stage must be tested for its core semantics, parameter validation, document handling, and interactions with adjacent stages. Stage tests live under `tests/core/operator/stages/$stageName/`. Data type coverage (section 1), error code validation (section 6), and boundary values follow the same rules as other operators.

**Core Semantics**:
- Primary operation on basic input
- Empty input and non-existent collection both produce correct output without error
- Works as the sole pipeline stage

**Parameter Validation**:
- Test every BSON type against the parameter. Numeric stages (`$limit`, `$skip`, `$sample`) accept int32, int64, whole-number double, whole-number Decimal128. Document stages (`$match`, `$project`, `$group`, `$set`) reject non-documents. String stages (`$count`, `$unwind`) reject non-strings.
- Extra keys in the stage document must error
- Validation errors fire at parse time — verify on empty and non-existent collections
- Test error precedence within a stage and cross-stage (first invalid stage by position wins)

**Document Handling**:
- Pass-through stages (`$limit`, `$skip`, `$sort`, `$match`) must preserve all BSON types unchanged, including deprecated types
- Reshaping stages (`$project`, `$set`, `$unset`, `$addFields`) must be tested with all BSON types as values
- New-document stages (`$count`, `$group`, `$bucket`, `$sortByCount`) must verify output field names and types

**Stage Interactions**:
- Multi-stage interaction tests belong in the parent `stages/` directory, not in individual stage folders. Per `FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md`, interactions between same-level features go in the parent folder (e.g., `stages/test_stages_combination_sort.py`, `stages/test_stages_position_match.py`).
- Test interactions where ordering affects results or where adjacent stages compose non-obviously (e.g., optimization coalescence, count-modifying vs non-count-modifying intervening stages, additive vs min-taking consecutive stages)
- Cover common multi-stage usage patterns for the stage under test

**Out of Scope**:
- Cross-cutting concerns (views, capped collections, timeseries) belong in their own directories
- Aggregate command options (`allowDiskUse`, etc.) belong in aggregate command tests
- Non-observable optimizer behavior belongs in `explain` tests

---

### 16. Collection Command Coverage
**Rule**: Each collection command must be tested for its core behavior, argument validation, response structure, and behavior across collection variants. Command tests live under `tests/core/collections/commands/$commandName/`. Data type coverage (section 1) and error code validation (section 6) follow the same rules as other features.

**Core Behavior**:
- Primary operation succeeds and returns expected response fields
- Behavior on non-existent collections (some commands succeed silently, others error)
- Behavior on empty collections created explicitly vs implicitly

**Argument Validation**:
- Test all BSON types against each required argument — invalid types must be rejected with correct error codes
- Test invalid values for string arguments (empty, system prefixes, illegal characters where applicable)
- Test accepted and rejected values for each command-specific option
- Unrecognized fields in the command document must be rejected

**Response Structure**:
- Verify all response fields and their types for the command's success case
- Verify response varies correctly based on collection state (e.g., index count, collection existence)

**Collection Variants**:
- The collection type is an input to the command — test each supported type with one representative case showing the command works, and verify correct errors for unsupported types
- Test command-specific behavior that varies by collection type (e.g., errors that only occur on views due to internal rewriting)
- Do not test the collection type's own semantics (pipeline composition, chaining, eviction) — those belong in the feature's dedicated directory

---

### 17. $expr Coverage in Filter/Query Contexts
**Rule**: Any command or stage that accepts a query/filter expression must include `$expr` tests.

**Applies to**: expression operators only. Query operators (under `operators/query/`) do not need `$expr` tests — they are tested directly in their query/filter form.

**Commands with a filter parameter**:
- `find`, `update`, `delete`, `findAndModify`, `count`, `distinct`

**Commands with a query parameter**:
- `listCollections`, `listDatabases`

**Stages with a match expression**:
- `$match`, `$lookup` subpipeline

---

### 18. Accumulator Coverage

  **Rule**: Each accumulator must be tested for its expression error propagation, empty-group result, order dependence, and sibling-accumulator interactions. Tests live under
  `tests/core/operator/accumulators/$accumulator/`. Sibling-accumulator interactions live in `tests/core/operator/accumulators/test_accumulators_$op_integration.py`.

  The expression-form of dual-form operators (`$max`, `$min`, `$sum`, `$avg`, `$first`, `$last`, etc.) is tested separately under `tests/core/operator/expressions/accumulator/$op/` and is out of scope for the
  accumulator-form file.

  **Expression Error Propagation**:
  Errors raised during sub-expression evaluation propagate through the accumulator without being caught:
  - `{$op: {$divide: [1, "$v"]}}` → `CONVERSION_FAILURE_ERROR` (field violation)
  - `{$op: {$divide: ["$v", 0]}}` → `DIVIDE_BY_ZERO_V2_ERROR` (literal violation)

  **Empty-Group Behavior**:
  Each accumulator defines a result for an empty group (zero matching documents). Verify the documented value for `{$group: {_id: null, r: {$op: ...}}}` against an empty collection. Result varies per accumulator
  (e.g. 0, null, [], {}) — refer to the accumulator's spec.

  **Order Dependence**:
  Some accumulators are order-dependent (their result depends on input order); others are order-independent. Verify per accumulator which category it belongs to per its spec, and:

  - For order-dependent accumulators, tests asserting a specific result must include a preceding `$sort`. Tests without `$sort` are flaky. (e.g. $first)
  - For order-independent accumulators, the result must be the same regardless of input order. Verify this by running the same input twice with different `$sort` directions and asserting identical results.

  **Tested in Other Folders** (in scope, but add under a different folder):
  - **Host-stage compatibility** — when adding a new accumulator, add one smoke case for each host stage that supports it (`$group`, `$bucket`, `$bucketAuto`, `$setWindowFields`) under that stage's folder
  (`stages/$stage/`), per the container-features rule (one test per sub-feature, no edge cases). Edge cases that are genuinely accumulator-specific stay in `accumulators/$op/`.
  - **Stage-level error codes** (e.g. `$bucketAuto` wrapping `DIVIDE_BY_ZERO_V2_ERROR` as `BadValue`) — under `stages/bucketAuto/`, parameterized over a representative accumulator.

 ** Scope that Covered by Other rules**:
  - **Numeric equivalence in grouping** (used by `$addToSet`, `$setUnion`) — covered by §9 Numeric Equivalence in Grouping/Comparison.
  - **Output type validation** — covered by §1 Data Type Coverage.

 **Out of Scope**:
  - **BSON comparison ordering** (used by `$max`/`$min`/`$top`/`$bottom`) — `bson_types/test_bson_types_ordering.py`; per-accumulator coverage limited to a small wiring sample.

### 19. Foundational Spec Behaviors — Test Once

  **Rule**: Foundational spec behaviors (BSON type ordering, collation rules, GeoJSON parsing, etc.) are tested comprehensively in their dedicated directory and assumed consistent
  elsewhere. Consumers test only that they correctly delegate to the foundational behavior, not the foundational behavior itself.

  **Rationale**: We are compatibility tests, not comprehensive functional tests. Re-verifying foundational behavior across every consumer multiplies cases without adding signal — if the foundational behavior diverges, it shows
  in the foundational test, not in 50 downstream tests.

  **Examples**:
  - BSON type ordering → `tests/core/bson_types/`. Operators that use it (e.g. `$max`, `$gt`, `$sort`) get 1-2 wiring cases, not the full type-pair matrix.
  - Collation comparison → `tests/core/collation/`. Commands that accept `collation` test syntactic acceptance only. Sub-fields testing and semantic behavior is in 'tests/core/collation/'.
  - GeoJSON parsing and validation → `geospatial/specifiers/geometry/`. Geo operators that accept GeoJSON — test that the operator wires to the GeoJSON parser, not GeoJSON syntax tests.
  - Wire-protocol namespace validation → TBD. Commands that take a namespace as their first field — single representative case, not the full character matrix.
  - Field path validation  → Issue #118.

  **Test naming convention**: wiring tests typically use the suffix `_bson_wiring.py` or `_<feature>_wiring.py`. Compare to `tests/core/operator/expressions/comparisons/gt/test_gt_bson_wiring.py` for the right
  shape — small, representative, explicitly named.

  **Carve-outs**: Per Rule 2's exception, parameters whose behavior genuinely varies per command (readConcern, writeConcern) are still tested exhaustively per command. The "test once" rule applies to behaviors that
   should be uniform across consumers.

### 20. Undocumented Type Coercion — Test Per Command

**Rule**: When a command parameter's *accepted-type set in practice* is broader than the spec documents, test the observed coercion in that command's test file. Engines may diverge here; documented-only coverage hides the gap.

**Rationale**: This is the inverse of §19. Foundational behaviors that have a single source of truth get tested once; coercion behaviors that have *no* source of truth get tested per consumer because that's the only place divergence shows up. Spec wording is necessary but not sufficient — the engine's actual accepted-type set is the contract real applications depend on.

**Applies to** (any param type, not just bool):
- **Boolean** params accepting numeric/null coercion — `bypassDocumentValidation`, `ordered`, `multi`, `upsert`, `dryRun`, `force`. Test `True`/`False`/omitted plus `1`/`0`/`1.0`/`0.0`/`Int64`/`Decimal128`/`null`/`-0.0`/`NaN`/`Infinity` per the canonical matrix (e.g. `tests/core/aggregation/commands/aggregate/test_aggregate_bypass_validation.py`).
- **Integer** params accepting whole-number doubles / Decimal128, or rejecting fractionals — `limit`, `skip`, `batchSize`, `maxTimeMS`, `freeSpaceTargetMB`. Test int32, Int64, whole-number double (`3.0`), whole-number Decimal128 (`"3"`), fractional double (`3.5`) rejection, negative values, overflow.
- **String** params with empty-string / null treatment — verify whether empty string and other types are coerced or rejected.
- **Document** params with null-as-omitted / empty-doc / array-rejection behavior — `query`, `sort`, `projection`, `writeConcern`, `let`, `collation`. Test that null is treated as omitted, empty doc is accepted, and array is rejected with the correct error code.

**Skip when**:
- §19 Foundational Spec Behaviors covers the coercion (e.g. BSON type ordering).
- The coercion is identical across all consumers and centralized in a dedicated test directory — delegate to that site instead.

**Method**: When in doubt, find the most thoroughly-tested consumer of the same parameter (grep `tests/core/` for the param name) and mirror its matrix. If no consumer has thorough coverage, this PR is a good place to set the precedent.

**Example**: `aggregate`'s `bypassDocumentValidation` matrix tests Int64, Decimal128, NaN, Infinity, -Infinity, negative zero alongside the documented `True`/`False`/null cases. PRs adding `bypassDocumentValidation` to `insert`, `update`, `findAndModify` should mirror this matrix.

### 21. Query-Operator Containers

**Rule**: Containers that accept a query expression (`$pull` condition, `arrayFilters`, positional `$`) test one case per query operator they accept (`$eq`, `$ne`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`, `$in`, `$nin`, `$exists`, `$type`, `$regex`, `$mod`, `$all`, `$size`, `$or`, `$not`, `$and`, plus implicit-and).

Same shape as §11, applied to a different axis: §11 covers expression operators in pipeline stages; §21 covers query operators in update/find features that take a query expression. Container-specific contracts (rejections, no-ops, shape constraints) live in the container's own test files alongside its other behavior.

## Test Category Checklist

For any DocumentDB feature, ensure coverage of:

- [ ] **Argument handling**: empty, single, multiple arguments; per-input-position coverage of types, expressions, and applicable rules
- [ ] **Input correlation**: meaningful cross-input combinations where inputs interact; skip redundant invalid-type cross-products

- [ ] **`$missing` field behavior**: per operator, per input position
- [ ] **Array index paths**: `$a.0.b` in expression context — verify validity outside filter queries
